    "Prophet is a libary for forecasting time series data. It was released by Facebookâ€™s Core Data Science team on [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookincubator/prophet) in February 2017. Models are \"fit\" with [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and you can read the paper [here](https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/static/prophet_paper_20170113.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Prophet works\n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet is an additive regression model, which models Time Series data with three main components: trend $T$, seasonality $S$ and holidays $H$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y(t) = T(t) + S(t) + H(t) + e_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trend**\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a piecewise linear model is used to capture the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "A piecewise linear model joins together individual linear models at *breakpoints* where the trend chagnes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These breakpoints can be automatically identified by the model or set manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, a logistic model can be used for non-linear growth with saturation or a flat model if there is no upwards/downards trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonality**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourier series are used to model seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dummy variables can be introduced when the seasonality is not constant throughout a period. For example, a weekly seasonal pattern that is different during the summer than it is during the rest of the year, or a daily seasonal pattern that is different on weekends vs. on weekdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Holidays**\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can provide a list of repeating/non-repeating special events, such as holidays, to prevent these irregularities being captured by the trend component.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Residual error**\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual represents any idiosyncratic changes which are not accommodated by the model"
